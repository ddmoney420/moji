# Add Package-Level Godoc Documentation to All Internal Packages

## Problem Description

The internal packages lack `doc.go` files with package-level documentation. This makes it harder for contributors to understand package purposes and find the right APIs. Godoc generates better documentation when packages have proper overview comments.

## Solution Approach

1. Create `doc.go` file in each internal package
2. Add package overview comment with purpose and key types
3. Include example usage where appropriate
4. Document any important constants or variables
5. Follow Go documentation best practices

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/artdb/` - ASCII art database
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/animate/` - Text animation effects
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/banner/` - FIGlet banner generation
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/batch/` - Batch processing
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/calendar/` - Calendar rendering
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/chain/` - Effect chaining
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/config/` - Configuration management
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/convert/` - Image to ASCII conversion
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/demo/` - Interactive demo system
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/dither/` - Dithering algorithms
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/effects/` - Text effects
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/errors/` - Error handling
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/export/` - Export formats
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/figlet/` - FIGlet font parsing
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/filters/` - Text filters
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/fortune/` - Fortunes and jokes
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/gradient/` - Color gradients
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/halfblock/` - Half-block ASCII rendering
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/imgproto/` - Terminal image protocols
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/kaomoji/` - Kaomoji emoticons
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/patterns/` - Borders and dividers
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/progress/` - Progress bars and spinners
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/qrcode/` - QR code generation
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/speech/` - Speech bubbles
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/styles/` - ANSI color styling
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/sysinfo/` - System information
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/terminal/` - Terminal detection
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/themes/` - Theme management
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/tree/` - Directory tree visualization
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/tui/` - Interactive TUI
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/ux/` - User experience utilities
- [x] Create doc.go for `internal/watch/` - File watching
- [x] All doc.go files pass `go doc` verification
- [x] go vet passes with no errors

## Technical Notes

- Doc format: `// Package name provides...`
- Include key types and functions in overview
- Add `Example` functions where useful
- Keep docs concise but informative

```
I'll implement this spec by adding package-level Godoc documentation to all internal packages in the moji project. Let me start by exploring the project structure and understanding the codebase.
Now let me explore the project structure to understand the internal packages:
Let me fix that command:
Good! I can see there are more packages than listed in the spec. Let me check which packages already have doc.go files:
Let me examine a few key packages to understand their structure and purpose. I'll start by reading their main files:
Let me list the files in these directories:
Good! Now I understand the structure. Let me read more files to understand what each package does:
Let me use the Explore agent to better understand the structure and purpose of each package:
Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive understanding of all the packages. Let me update my todo list to include all 32 packages and start creating the doc.go files:
Now I'll create all the doc.go files. Let me start systematically:
Excellent! All doc.go files have been created. Now let me verify they're all correct and run go vet:
Now let me verify all doc.go files exist and then run go vet:
Perfect! All 32 doc.go files are present. Now let me run go vet to ensure there are no errors:
Excellent! Let me also verify that go doc can read the documentation properly:
Perfect! The documentation is being generated correctly. Now let me update the spec file and commit the changes:
Let me read the spec file and update it with all acceptance criteria checked:
Now I'll update the spec file to mark all acceptance criteria as complete and add the additional packages that weren't in the original list:
Now let me add the model information to the spec and change status to completed:
Perfect! Now let me commit the changes:
Now I'll stage and commit all the doc.go files and the spec update:
Perfect! Let me verify the git status is clean:
The only untracked change is the other spec file which we shouldn't touch. Let me verify all our doc.go files are properly in place:
Excellent! Let me update the todo list to mark completion:
Perfect! I have successfully completed the spec. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary

I have successfully completed the spec to add package-level Godoc documentation to all internal packages in the moji project.

### What Was Accomplished

✅ **Created 32 doc.go files** for all internal packages:
- Core packages: artdb, banner, batch, calendar, chain, config, convert, dither, effects, export, figlet, filters, gradient, imgproto, terminal, themes, tui, watch
- Animation & effects: animate
- System/demo: demo, sysinfo
- Advanced features: errors, fortune, halfblock, kaomoji, patterns, progress, qrcode, speech, styles, tree, ux

### Documentation Quality

Each `doc.go` file includes:
- **Clear package purpose**: Concise statement of what the package provides
- **Detailed functionality overview**: Description of key capabilities
- **Key types and functions**: Important exported APIs
- **Example usage**: Code examples showing common use cases

### Verification

✅ **All verifications passed:**
- All 32 doc.go files created and present
- `go vet ./internal/...` - No errors
- `go doc` successfully reads and displays documentation
- Commit: `3a227da` - All changes tracked in git

### Spec Completion

All 34 acceptance criteria marked as complete:
- ✅ 32 doc.go files created (covering all packages)
- ✅ All doc.go files pass `go doc` verification
- ✅ `go vet` passes with no errors
- ✅ Spec updated and committed with model information

The project now has comprehensive package-level documentation that will help contributors understand the purpose and usage of each internal package.```
